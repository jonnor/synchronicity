Peoples’movement rhythms can synchronize unintentionally,
for example when walkingside by side, or intentionally, as when military units march.
The tendency to syn-chronize movement rhythms has been theorized to
play an important role in the formation of a social unit.

 In nature, neural synchrony yields behavioral synchrony.
Humans use behavioral synchrony to promote neural synchrony, and thus, social bonding.
This reverse-engineering of social connection is an important innovation
likely underlying this distinctively human capacity to create large-scale social coordination and cohesion.

who later instructed them to kill the bugs put approximately 54 percent more bugs
into the device than did those in the control condition.
...twice as many bugs into the funnel as did participants who walked in synchrony with
a different experimenter than the one who instructed them to terminate the insects.


Personal experience:
If a person is sleeping or resting on your chest,
and you slow your breathing down or even hold your breath,
the person will often adopt their breath to match
(automatically, without voluntary/concious action)
